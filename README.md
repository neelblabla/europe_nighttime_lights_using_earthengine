# visualising_europe_nighttime_lights_using_earthengine

With all the fireworks and lights, New Year's eve in Europe is celebrated no different than the Diwali night in India. Here's an approximation of how some countries look from the sky.

I used Earth Engine APIs to generate these maps. The local red hotspots are prime cities within the geographies.

Nighttime light data has relevance in so many fields - it can be an indicator of social activity, or can help estimate number of restaurants, transit stations, and other economical businesses in the relevant area. It can help track movement patterns and even ensure safety for travellers.

One of the recent studies suggest that night-time lights can also be correlated to the GDP of a country - https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/720458.

Also, notice the mildly dispersed light over north of Sweden? My best guess is that we managed to capture the northern lights 'Aurora' (or not).
